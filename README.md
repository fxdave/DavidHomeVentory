## Features

- **Nested boxes**: boxes hold items and other boxes, as deep as you like.
- **Search**: find any item and see its full location, e.g. `Basement / Shelf 1 / Brave Fox`.
- **QR stickers**: print sticker sheets; scanning a new sticker creates its box.
- **Move things**: cut a box and paste it elsewhere; its contents move with it.
- **Android app and PWA**: `davidhomeventory://` QR links open the app directly.
- **Lightweight**: one Node.js process and a SQLite file. No accounts, no cloud.
